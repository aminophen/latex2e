**** Add to hook example-hook (top-level) on input line ... <- [code from 'top-level']
**** Add to hook example-hook (foo) on input line ... <- [code from package 'foo']
**** Add to hook example-hook (bar) on input line ... <- [from package 'bar']
**** Add to hook example-hook (baz) on input line ... <- [package 'baz' is here]
Update code for hook 'example-hook' on input line ...:
  normal rule foo|baz: > found
 default rule baz|bar: < found
Code labels for sorting:
 foo, bar and baz
Data structure for label rules:
 foo = 1 -> 
 bar = 1 -> 
 baz = 0 -> foo -> bar
Handled code for baz
Handled code for foo
Handled code for bar
-> The hook 'example-hook':
> Code chunks:
>     foo -> [code from package 'foo']
>     bar -> [from package 'bar']
>     baz -> [package 'baz' is here]
> Document-level (top-level) code (executed last):
>     -> [code from 'top-level']
> Extra code for next invocation:
>     -> [one-time code]
> Rules:
>     foo|baz with relation >
>     baz|bar with default relation <
> Execution order (after applying rules):
>     baz, foo, bar.
